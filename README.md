# XibPiercer
Xcode plugin to simulate editing xibs on a train

## Install using Alcatraz
Once installed, the plugin will randomly jiggle your Xcode window, simulating the experience of editing your code or Xib on a train, 
bus, sedan chair, etc.

## TODO: 
1. Figure out how to detect whether the current file is a Xib and only turn the jiggle on for Xib files.
